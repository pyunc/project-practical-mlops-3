## Objetive

This project can be much better, there are some known issues and possible upgrades that can be made. So, clone the repository, work on something and make a pull request.

Open tasks:

* Deploy the model in production (I donâ€™t think it need to train again, it can reuse the same model)

## Initial setup

python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
